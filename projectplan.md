# Project Delivery Plan

> **Reference:** Execute this plan only after cross-checking context in [`README.md`](README.md), [`PRD.md`](PRD.md), and [`architecture.md`](architecture.md). Do **not** advance into any phase marked with unresolved decisions until those choices are documented and approved.

## Phase 0 – Alignment & Governance
1. **Establish project leadership pod (PM, Tech Lead, Voice Specialist).**  
   _Justification:_ Centralizes decision-making for the many cross-functional dependencies.
2. **Confirm documentation lock.** Verify the latest versions of README, PRD, architecture outline, and this plan are in sync.  
   _Justification:_ Prevents rework later in the lifecycle.
3. **Define approval workflow.** Decide how unresolved decisions get escalated (RFC, steering meeting).  
   _Justification:_ Ensures decisions unblock engineering quickly.

## Phase 1 – Critical Decisions (Blocking)
- **Backend Framework & Hosting:** FastAPI vs Node stack; containers vs serverless.  
  _Instruction:_ No API work until chosen.
- **Vector Store Provider:** Qdrant vs alternatives + hosting approach.  
  _Instruction:_ Retrieval pipeline implementation on hold until finalized.
- **Telephony Provider:** Twilio vs Vonage vs others.  
  _Instruction:_ Voice agent development blocked until selected.
- **Speech Stack:** STT/TTS vendor(s) and protocol (WebRTC vs SIP).  
  _Instruction:_ Do not build telephony pipeline without this decision.
- **Analytics Stack:** ClickHouse vs Postgres OLAP vs Elastic.  
  _Instruction:_ Defer admin analytics UI/backend until locked.
- **Auth & Config tooling:** Authentication provider, feature flag system, config storage.  
  _Instruction:_ RBAC/tenant config work paused until decided.
- **Testing & CI Approach:** Frameworks for API, ingestion, and voice simulations.  
  _Instruction:_ CI/CD setup deferred until plan approved.

_Justification for Phase 1:_ These selections cascade into infrastructure, SDK choices, data schemas, and contracts; locking them first reduces refactors.

## Phase 2 – Platform Foundations
1. **Provision core infrastructure** (repositories, IaC templates, base container images).  
   _Justification:_ Provides scaffolding for parallel team contributions.
2. **Set up dev/test environments** mirroring chosen hosting.  
   _Justification:_ Enables early integration and load tests.
3. **Implement authentication & tenant scaffolding** aligned with selected provider.  
   _Justification:_ Security baseline needed for any subsequent feature development.
4. **Configure feature flag framework** for gating telephony, structured data, etc.  
   _Justification:_ Allows incremental rollout.

_Dependencies:_ Requires Phase 1 decisions.

## Phase 3 – Data Ingestion Backbone
1. **Build ingestion framework** (worker queue, scheduler).  
   _Justification:_ Knowledge base must exist before retrieval tuning.
2. **Implement priority connectors** (e.g., Google Drive, CSV uploads).  
   _Justification:_ Supplies immediate data for testing downstream flows.
3. **Structured data service MVP** with schema catalog and SQL guardrails.  
   _Justification:_ Enables hybrid answers demanded in PRD.
4. **Deduplication & tagging pipeline** (hashing + similarity).  
   _Justification:_ Ensures quality of retrieval.

_Dependencies:_ Requires worker tech and storage decisions.

## Phase 4 – Retrieval & LLM Layer
1. **Vector store integration** with namespace isolation.  
   _Justification:_ Backing store for retrieval engine.
2. **Implement retrieval engine** (dense/hybrid pipeline, prompt assembly).  
   _Justification:_ Core to delivering grounded answers.
3. **LLM service abstraction** with streaming, fallback routing, guardrails.  
   _Justification:_ Supports both web and voice agents consistently.
4. **Evaluation harness setup** (golden Q&A, latency metrics).  
   _Justification:_ Validates retrieval precision targets.

_Dependencies:_ Ingestion data available; LLM/provider decisions finalized.

## Phase 5 – Interaction Channels
### 5.1 Web Portals
1. **Admin portal skeleton** (auth, navigation, feature flags).  
   _Justification:_ Needed to manage connectors and review analytics.
2. **Employee knowledge portal** chat UI with citations, history.  
   _Justification:_ Core internal use case; validates retrieval UX.
3. **Customer portal** with scoped dataset controls.  
   _Justification:_ Supports external-facing commitments in PRD.

### 5.2 Telephone Support Agent
1. **Telephony webhook/stream handler** using chosen provider.  
   _Justification:_ Entry point for calls.
2. **Speech pipeline integration** (STT intake, TTS response).  
   _Justification:_ Converts between audio and text for RAG flow.
3. **Call state manager** (DTMF/spoken intents, escalation triggers).  
   _Justification:_ Fulfills conversational requirements and compliance needs.
4. **Transcript & recording storage** with consent capture hooks.  
   _Justification:_ Needed for audit and analytics commitments.

_Dependencies:_ Phases 3–4 complete; Phase 1 voice decisions resolved.

## Phase 6 – Admin & Analytics
1. **Usage analytics ingestion** (query volume, latency, deflection).  
   _Justification:_ Tracks success metrics.
2. **Call analytics dashboard** (transcript search, confidence trends).  
   _Justification:_ Meets README/PRD commitments for phone support oversight.
3. **Alerting & observability instrumentation** (Prometheus/Loki etc.).  
   _Justification:_ Supports SLA monitoring.

_Dependencies:_ Requires analytics stack decision, data from prior phases.

## Phase 7 – Quality Assurance & Hardening
1. **End-to-end test suites** for web chat, ingestion, and voice flows using chosen frameworks.  
   _Justification:_ Prevent regressions.
2. **Load & latency testing** (100+ concurrent sessions, telephony round-trip <1.5s).  
   _Justification:_ Validates PRD performance metrics.
3. **Security review** (RBAC enforcement, data retention, call consent).  
   _Justification:_ Addresses compliance expectations.
4. **Chaos/failover drills** for telephony and retrieval components.  
   _Justification:_ Ensures resilience before launch.

_Dependencies:_ Functional features complete.

## Phase 8 – Readiness & Launch
1. **Documentation finalization** (runbooks, feature flag metrics, onboarding guides).  
   _Justification:_ Supports handoff to support teams.
2. **Pilot tenant onboarding** with controlled data set.  
   _Justification:_ Real-world validation prior to broad release.
3. **Go/no-go review** referencing success metrics and QA results.  
   _Justification:_ Formal checkpoint to approve launch.
4. **Production rollout** with staged enablement via feature flags.  
   _Justification:_ Allows controlled exposure and rollback.

## Phase 9 – Post-Launch Iteration
1. **Collect feedback & telemetry** from pilot and early adopters.  
   _Justification:_ Guides roadmap adjustments.
2. **Backlog grooming** for enhancements (multi-tenant SaaS, prompt registry UI).  
   _Justification:_ Continues alignment with roadmap.
3. **Operational reviews** (cost, performance, support load).  
   _Justification:_ Ensures sustainability of the deployment.

## Ongoing Decision Log Instructions
- Maintain a visible log (appendix or linked RFC) capturing each decision, owner, date, and rationale.
- If any choice remains undecided when reaching its dependent phase, halt development and escalate via the governance process.

## Notes for Agents
- Do **not** begin implementation of any phase with outstanding decision gates.
- Keep README, PRD, architecture, and this plan synchronized whenever scope changes.
- Document deviations from this plan in an addendum that references the relevant sections.
